### Keyword Integration Strategy

1. **Title & Subtitle/Short Description:** Include highest-value keywords directly in the title and subtitle/short description for maximum visibility.

2. **iOS Keyword Field:** Pack with relevant keywords separated by commas (no spaces) to maximize the 100-character limit. Focus on terms not already in the title or subtitle.

3. **Description:** Naturally incorporate secondary and long-tail keywords throughout the description to enhance ranking for these terms, particularly important for Google Play's algorithm.

4. **Strategic Differentiation:** Focus keyword strategy on "simple power management" rather than competing with full remote desktop solutions. Our niche is specific remote shutdown/restart functionality that's easy to use.

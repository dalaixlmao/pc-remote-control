# Remote PC Control Refactoring Plan

## Project Overview
Remote PC Control is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo that allows users to remotely control a computer by sending shutdown and restart commands to a server.

## Code Smells and Issues Identified

### 1. App.js Issues
- **Unused imports and code**: There are imported modules and commented-out code that are not being used (`NetworkInfo`, commented-out `exec` import, and `shutdown` import)
- **Unused functions**: `handleShutdown` and `handleRestart` are defined but never used
- **Hardcoded IP address**: The server IP is hardcoded, making the app less flexible and requiring code changes to connect to different servers
- **Poor code organization**: The styles and component logic are all in a single file
- **Missing error handling**: No user-facing error messages when server communication fails

### 2. server.js Issues
- **Platform-specific commands**: The shutdown/restart commands are Windows-specific (`shutdown /s /t 0`), with no consideration for other operating systems
- **Limited error handling**: Error messages from the server could be more descriptive
- **No security measures**: The server accepts requests without any authentication or verification

## Refactoring Plan

### 1. App.js Refactoring
- Remove unused imports and commented code
- Remove unused functions
- Create a configuration screen to allow the user to input and save the server IP address
- Split the code into separate components:
  - Create a components directory
  - Extract button components to their own files
  - Extract styles to separate files
- Add proper error handling and user feedback for server communication

### 2. server.js Refactoring
- Add platform detection to use appropriate shutdown/restart commands for different operating systems
- Enhance error handling with more descriptive messages
- Add basic authentication mechanism or API key for security

## Verification Steps
- Test the application after each significant change
- Ensure the app can still connect to the server and execute commands
- Verify that the app works properly with different server IP addresses
- Check that error handling works correctly when the server is unavailable

## Implementation Order
1. Clean up unused code in App.js
2. Refactor server.js to handle different operating systems
3. Implement configuration screen for server IP
4. Extract components and styles to separate files
5. Add error handling and user feedback
